# RockPaperScissors_HandDetection
Fun project of the game Rock Paper Scissors. It detects the hand shown on the screen and says whether it is rock, paper or scissors.

In this project i have trained the model in the jupyter notebook with anaconda prompt. I have saved this project in a folder where there is another folder named data and a python file named detect_and_display.py which is the code to detect and display , data folder contains three folders namely rock, paper and scissors which contain images.

The model is trained by importing several modules or libraries like tensorflow, seaborn, keras, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot,......

A folder named rps_hand_detector.h5 will be saved after the training of the model which will be further useful for the project.

After executing the python file detect_and_display.py from vs code or form anaconda prompt u will get a popup screen which contains a green box where u should place ur hand such that it fits in the box and show some hand movements or positions representing rock, paper or scissors.

Andddd the required output is displayed on the screen with the accuracy!!!!
